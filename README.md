Hot/warm wallet inventory, address derivation/rotation, and per-chain balance tracking for the crypto on-ramp custody layer.

## Overview / Responsibilities

Wallet Management is the custody-inventory backbone of the on-ramp. It owns the
lifecycle and metadata of every hot, warm, and cold wallet, derives and rotates
on-chain deposit/receive addresses per chain, tracks confirmed balances, manages
UTXO and nonce state, and maps each wallet to the MPC `key_id` used for signing.

It is called synchronously by the **MPC Signing Service** (key_id lookup) and the
**Blockchain Gateway** (broadcast + confirmation feedback), and asynchronously by
**Treasury Orchestration** for hot-wallet funding. Withdrawals pass through
address whitelisting via the **Policy / Risk Engine** before being released.

Core responsibilities:

- Maintain hot/warm/cold wallet inventory and labels.
- Derive deterministic addresses per chain (EVM BIP-44, Solana ed25519, BTC UTXO).
- Rotate receive addresses on a configurable cadence and on demand.
- Track per-chain, per-asset balances with chain-appropriate confirmation depth.
- Manage BTC UTXO set (selection, locking, marking spent) and EVM nonces.
- Map each wallet to its MPC `key_id` for threshold signing.
- Issue funding requests to Treasury Orchestration when hot-wallet balances drop.
- Enforce withdrawal destination whitelisting in concert with the Policy Engine.
- Emit wallet lifecycle and balance audit events to the Audit / Event Log.

## Language & Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (module path `github.com/onramp/wallet-management`).
- **Address derivation:** BIP-32/44 deterministic derivation per chain:
  - EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism): BIP-44 path
    `m/44'/60'/0'/0/x`, Keccak-256 / EIP-55 checksummed addresses.
  - Solana: ed25519 BIP-44 path `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`, base58 addresses.
  - Bitcoin (UTXO): BIP-44 / BIP-49 / BIP-84 paths, native SegWit bech32 addresses,
    full UTXO tracking and selection.
- **Balance sync:** polling + webhook hybrid driven by Blockchain Gateway
  confirmation events; per-chain confirmation depth thresholds.
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL (wallets, addresses, balances, UTXOs, nonces,
  withdrawal requests, key mappings) + Redis (nonce lock, idempotency keys,
  derivation cache).
- **RPC:** REST for control plane + gRPC for internal service-to-service calls
  from MPC Signing and Blockchain Gateway.

## System Requirements

### Wallet inventory

- Support wallet types `hot`, `warm`, `cold` with distinct policy and access
  profiles. Hot wallets are spendable via MPC signing; warm require a quorum
  policy uplift; cold are receive-only / require out-of-band movement.
- Each wallet is scoped to a single `chain` and carries a human-readable `label`,
  an operational state (`active`, `paused`, `retired`), and a custody provider
  reference (in-house MPC or external custodian).
- Wallet-to-`key_id` mapping is authoritative: the MPC Signing Service reads the
  mapping to resolve which threshold key signs for a given wallet/address.

### Deterministic address derivation

- EVM: BIP-44 `m/44'/60'/0'/0/index`; addresses are EIP-55 checksummed.
- Solana: ed25519 BIP-44 `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`; one derived address per wallet.
- BTC (UTXO): BIP-44/49/84 with change-chain separation; bech32 native SegWit.
- Derivation index is monotonic and persisted; gaps are tracked for gap-limit
  scanning. Derived public addresses only — private material never leaves the
  MPC layer.

### Address rotation policy

- Default rotation cadence configurable per chain (e.g. rotate receive address
  every N days or after M receives). Overridable per wallet.
- On-demand derivation endpoint for one-off address generation (deposits,
  internal transfers).
- Retired addresses remain valid for collection but are flagged
  `deprecated` and excluded from new share-outs.

### Per-chain balance tracking with confirmation depth

- Balances are tracked per `(wallet_id, asset)` and reconciled against
  Blockchain Gateway confirmation events.
- Confirmation thresholds are chain-specific:
  - EVM: configurable (default 12-32 blocks depending on chain reorg risk).
  - BTC: 6 confirmations default, configurable.
  - Solana: finalized slot only.
- Expose both `confirmed` and `pending` balances; downstream services must not
  spend `pending` balances.

### UTXO management (BTC)

- Track the full UTXO set per BTC wallet: outpoint, value, script type,
  confirmation count, lock status.
- Support UTXO locking during withdrawal construction to prevent double-spend.
- Mark UTXOs spent on broadcast and prune on finality; restore on reorg.

### Nonce management (EVM)

- Maintain a per-wallet, per-chain pending nonce counter in PostgreSQL.
- Redis-backed nonce lock to serialize concurrent withdrawal construction and
  prevent nonce gaps / collisions.
- Support parallelizable transactions via nonce pre-allocation with rollback on
  broadcast failure.

### Wallet-to-`key_id` mapping for MPC

- Each wallet is bound to exactly one MPC `key_id` at provisioning time.
- Key rotation is supported via a new `key_id` binding with a cooling-off period
  during which both keys may sign.

### Funding requests to treasury

- When a hot wallet's confirmed balance drops below a configurable threshold,
  Wallet Management emits a funding request to Treasury Orchestration.
- Funding requests are idempotent and tracked in `funding_requests` with state
  `requested`, `approved`, `settled`, `rejected`.

### Withdrawal address whitelisting

- Outbound withdrawals may only be sent to addresses whitelisted by the
  Policy / Risk Engine. Wallet Management performs the whitelist lookup
  synchronously before constructing a withdrawal.
- Supports per-user and per-partner whitelist scopes; whitelist entries carry
  an expiry and a confidence score from KYT.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Address derivation latency (p99) | < 10 ms (cached public-key derivation) |
| Balance consistency | Strongly consistent with Blockchain Gateway event log; eventual between polling and webhook. |
| Balance refresh cadence | On-chain events drive immediate refresh; full reconciliation poll every 60 s per wallet as backstop. |
| Availability | 99.99% — service is on the withdrawal hot path; outage blocks user withdrawals. |
| Durability | All wallet/derivation state persisted before acknowledgement; no in-memory-only authoritative state. |
| Throughput | Sustain 500 derivation/s and 2,000 balance reads/s per region. |
| Security | All write endpoints require mTLS + service identity; PII-free service. |

## Technical Specifications

### API surface

- **REST** (control plane, JSON over HTTPS) — wallet lifecycle, address
  derivation, balance queries, withdrawals, funding requests.
- **gRPC** (internal service-to-service) — used by MPC Signing Service for
  `key_id` lookup and by Blockchain Gateway for confirmation callbacks.
